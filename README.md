# AccessibilityDemo
This repository is for the presentation I gave on Implementing Accessibility in iOS at the [Cincinnati Cocoa Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/CincyCocoaDev/events/226820680/) on 7 January 2016.

I have included my slides and the Accessibility Implementation checklist. Eventually I hope to have a demo project for demonstrating how to implement accessibility features in iOS.
