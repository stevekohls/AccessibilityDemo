# AccessibilityDemo
This repository is for the presentation I gave on Implementing Accessibility in iOS at the [Cincinnati Cocoa Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/CincyCocoaDev/events/226820680/) on 7 January 2016.

A video of the talk is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qu6lf33GqtM).

I have included my [slides](implementing%20accessibility.pdf) and the Accessibility Implementation [checklist](AccessibilityImplementationChecklist.md).

Eventually I hope to have a demo project for demonstrating how to implement accessibility features in iOS.
